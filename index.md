## Aim of this project

Using a machine learning based approach to predict hemorrhagic stroke severity in susceptible patients.

## The Beneficiaries

Doctors could make the best use of this approach to decide and act upon accordingly for patients with high risk would require different treatment and medication since the time of admission. This could save lives since a time of action plays a crucial role in determining the lifespan of a patient stuck in coma. 
In return, such an approach where a model is trained over time with more such datapoints (new patients) could save more lives thereby increasing the medical standards. 

## Initital Hypothesis  
The primary assumption made was that all medical factors could be contributing factors to predict the severity of strokes in patients.  

## Documentation  
This repo has all the project files for building an ML model to predict the severity of acute ischemic strokes (brain strokes) observed in patients. For quick navigation, use the following links:
